# DATA440_Project
Automations and Workflows project

In this project, I'd like to simulate the immune response in a body when presented with a stressor. This would hopefully involve the simulation of immune cell proliferation, cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and quantifiable levels of several types of immune cells in the form of charts. The user may input the number of receptors on specific immune cells, type of stress (chronic, acute), and starting levels of immune cells. The output will show a timelapse of how the stressor has altered the immune response.
