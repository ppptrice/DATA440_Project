# DATA440_Project
Automations and Workflows project

In this project, I'd like to simulate an aspect of the immune response in a body when presented with a stressor. This involves the simulation cytokine and chemokine levels. The project will first gather summary statistics from a cytokine dataset in order to determine the baseline cytokine levels in a healthy human adult body. The user may generate a random individual's cytokine data depending on the current data provided. The random individual will have cytokine levels dependent on the dataset's mean and variance of each cytokine level.

Current objectives
---
- write functions to visualize summary statistics of the data depending on user input
- generate random data with a function based on the cytokine data
  - model the distribution of the data (normal, poisson, etc.)
